# Merge Intervals Pattern

The Merge Intervals Pattern is a common technique for solving problems that involve overlapping intervals, often found in scenarios like scheduling, time management, and resource allocation. This pattern is designed to merge or combine intervals with common boundaries to simplify or optimize a problem.

## Key Characteristics:

- **Intervals:** The Merge Intervals Pattern focuses on intervals, which are typically defined by two values: a start point and an end point.

- **Sorting:** Sorting the intervals is often the first step in this pattern, as it allows for efficient merging.

## Common Use Cases:

1. **Interval Overlap:** Problems involving identifying overlapping intervals or merging intersecting intervals.

2. **Optimizing Resource Allocation:** Tasks related to optimizing resource allocation within time frames or ranges.

3. **Scheduling and Time Management:** Scheduling events or tasks and finding gaps or overlaps in schedules.

## Methodology:

The Merge Intervals Pattern follows a systematic approach:

1. **Sort the Intervals:** Start by sorting the intervals based on their start points. This is crucial for the merging process.

2. **Iterate Through Intervals:** Traverse through the sorted intervals one by one. Maintain a current interval and a result list for the merged intervals.

3. **Comparison and Merging:** For each interval, compare its start point with the end point of the current interval. If there is an overlap, merge the intervals by updating the end point of the current interval.

4. **Non-Overlap Handling:** If no overlap is detected, add the current interval to the result list and set the current interval to the new one.

5. **Complete the Process:** Continue this process until all intervals are processed. The result list will contain the merged intervals.

## Tips for Using Merge Intervals:

- **Sort First:** Always sort the intervals based on their start points before merging.

- **Be Mindful of Edge Cases:** Pay attention to edge cases, including intervals with identical start and end points.

- **Handle Single Intervals:** Consider how to handle single intervals that do not overlap with others.

- **Visualization:** Visualizing intervals on a timeline or number line can be helpful for understanding and solving problems in this pattern.

- **Efficiency:** The pattern is known for its efficiency in solving interval-related problems, especially when the intervals are sorted.

## Example Problems:

1. **Merge Intervals:** Given a collection of intervals, merge any overlapping intervals.

2. **Meeting Rooms II:** Calculate the minimum number of conference rooms required to accommodate a list of meetings.

3. **Employee Free Time:** Find the free time between schedules of employees.

## Conclusion:

The Merge Intervals Pattern is a valuable tool for efficiently handling problems involving intervals, overlaps, scheduling, and resource allocation. Sorting and merging intervals simplifies problems and optimizes solutions in various real-world scenarios.
