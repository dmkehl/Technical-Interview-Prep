## Two Pointer Pattern

[ðŸ”¼ Back to top](#top)

<a id="pointers-at-both-ends"></a>

### Pointers at Both Ends

- **Methodology:** The Two Pointers pattern involves using two pointers to traverse data structures such as arrays or strings. They often move towards each other or in the same direction, depending on the problem. It's useful for solving problems that require comparisons or checks involving multiple elements in linear time.

- **Tips:**
  - Sort the data or select appropriate data structures when needed.
  - This pattern can be used to find pairs, subarrays, or specific elements efficiently.
  - Consider variations of the Two Pointers pattern, like "Pointers at Both Ends" or "Merging Two Arrays."

### Slow & Fast Pointers

- **Methodology:** The Fast & Slow Pointers pattern uses two pointers that move through the data at different speeds. One pointer moves faster (fast), while the other moves slower (slow). It's often used for tasks like finding cycles in linked lists, determining middle elements, or reaching specific conditions.

- **Tips:**
  - Use one pointer that advances slower and another that advances faster.
  - Identify problems where two pointers can be used to compare, find, or reach a solution.
  - Common applications include detecting cycles, finding middle elements, and determining if a value exists in a data structure.

## Hash Map Pattern

- **Methodology:** The hash map pattern, also known as the dictionary or map pattern in various programming languages, is widely used to solve many problems efficiently. It involves utilizing a data structure that stores key-value pairs, allowing for constant-time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.

- **Tips:**
  - Understand the problem constraints and identify the need for efficient data storage and retrieval.
  - Choose the appropriate programming language-specific implementation of the hash map, such as dictionaries, objects, or hash maps.
  - Ensure that keys in the hash map are unique and that the chosen keys effectively represent the data you are trying to store.
  - Utilize the hash map for constant-time insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.
  - Be aware of potential collisions and consider implementing collision resolution strategies if necessary.
  - Optimize space usage by considering the trade-offs between memory usage and time complexity.
  - Leverage the hash map for tracking element frequencies, storing relationships, or mapping entities efficiently.
  - Test the solution rigorously with different input sizes and edge cases to verify its correctness and efficiency.

## Merge Intervals Pattern

- **Methodology:** The Fast & Slow Pointers pattern uses two pointers that move through the data at different speeds. One pointer moves faster (fast), while the other moves slower (slow). It's often used for tasks like finding cycles in linked lists, determining middle elements, or reaching specific conditions.

- **Tips:**
  - Use one pointer that advances slower and another that advances faster.
  - Identify problems where two pointers can be used to compare, find, or reach a solution.
  - Common applications include detecting cycles, finding middle elements, and determining if a value exists in a data structure.

## Cyclic Sort Pattern

- **Methodology:** The Cyclic Sort pattern is used to sort a list with cyclic or in-place operations. It's commonly used for problems that ask for missing or duplicated elements in a range or for tasks where elements need to be rearranged in a specific way.

- **Tips:**
  - Begin sorting from the first element and swap elements to their correct positions.
  - Use this pattern when the problem's constraints allow for cyclic or in-place operations.
  - Consider scenarios where data must be sorted efficiently.
