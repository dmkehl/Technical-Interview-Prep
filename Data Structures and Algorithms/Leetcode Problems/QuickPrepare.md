# Quick Prepare

This list of ~70 problems is a great source for learning Data Structures & Algorithms initially to become interview ready. However, I recommend looking at <br>
the [All Problems](./AllProblems.md) list in order to gain a deep understanding of each of the patterns in depth or to prepare on a specific pattern you are stuggling <br>
with or know you will be seeing soon in an interview. This list is meant to be completed in order as a lot of the knowledge / insight from one problem type is likely <br>
to be useful and / or vital to learning the next. If you are unfamiliar with a specific data type listed, please review the material [here](../Data%20Structures/DataStructures.md) in order to gain the <br>
necessary knowledge to succeed at the problem.
