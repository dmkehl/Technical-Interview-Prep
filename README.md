# Technical Interview Prep

This repository is designed to contain a multitude of information that can be used to prepare for technical interviews. I
have included information on data structures and algorithms currently but I plan on adding other things like behavioral questions, language specific questions, and concept based questions (i.e. OOP) in the future. Please find the links below to the different
files containing the desired information.

**<p style="text-align: center;"> ❗ ❗ ❗IMPORTANT❗ ❗ ❗</p>**

**<p style="text-align: center;">If you are new to Data Structures & Algorithm's, start with [Quick Prepare](./Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms/Leetcode%20Problems/QuickPrepare.md) to get a basic <br>understanding of the concepts before moving onto the larger problem set</p>**
