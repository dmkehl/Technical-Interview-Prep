# Technical Interview Prep

This repository is designed to be a guide to help you learn the design patterns that are used to solve
leetcode style questions in technical interviews. This repository will include links to explain the concepts as well as links
to leetcode questions that can be used to practice the concepts discussed. I hope you find it useful.
